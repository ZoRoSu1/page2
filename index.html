            * I hurt me * 3 words I still cannot understand it
            I can hear the whispering again!
            Those voices in my head are telling me things confusing
            me, i can't focus. My thoughts are bloody and bleeding,
            and blood is bleeding all over my mind I can't sleep
            anymore, all I see is darkness … Am I dying cause I can’t
            see the stars. Where are they? I'm surely dead and I am
            stuck in this constant battle. I'm freezing. Those walls
            can't stop staring at me. I need help! « Please I need to
            get out of here «All I need is a sword to open my skull
            and get rid of those voices. It’s been 3 months since I
            was locked in this room. I still don’t know why, i seer
            next to the window a took my book. At least i find
            peaxe in reading …. Then the door opened and it was
            her ……
            <br> <br>

            Finally ! It’s the deadline I m officially starting my
            job as psychiatrist in the most popular mental health
            facility. I ve been waiting for this day years ago . It was
            my dream job since my mother died i was so young
            and i couldn’t understand why she died . she used to be
            optimistic and in a good mood most of the time . They
            told me that she suffered from a certain disease named
            schizophrenia _ A sever menthal health disorder ,
            people with it often experience difficulties in
            distinguishing between what is real and what is not _
            From that moment i decided to be a psychiatrist cause
            it's not fair to see the closest people to you dying even
            if they seems healthy. Her death was a terrible part of
            my life and i promised my self to help those pour
            people who deserve to live in the wat they prefer . .
            <br> 
            I was so excited to meet my first patient and I hope he
            or she will appreciate me .
            <br> <br> 
            Once I arrived at the center I met the director jack , _ a
            young man , with a black suit he is on his thirteenth
            maybe _
            <br> <br> 
            « it’s my honor to meet you Ms Jack » I said <br>
            « oh ! Welcome to our center Dr. Stella , finally we
            met I you . my colleague told how competent you are i
            m so eager to see u proving it » <br> 
            « I m over the moon Mrs jack u will not be
            diponated » <br> 
            « sow , this is Jules -à young women with a blond hear
            and a cute face - she will lead u to ur new office, wish
            u the best mss Stella » <br>
            « thank you mrs Jack» and he went way he was
            precipitate maybe he has some urgent work . Then the
            young girl jules asked me « I guess your the new
            doctor 9right I guess it’s Stella bloom right ) omg how I
            feel proud of myself when they talked to me as a
            doctor, I nod « yes I am Stella nice to meet you jules )
            <br>
            Nice to meet you too ) she said ( before we go to ur
            office I have to show the details of this center ) I Wass
            so excited
            <br>
            « off course that’s so kind » 
            <br>
            Tthe when we were in the 1st floor she said « it’s
            dedicated to the young patient whom their age is
            between 10 _ 17 ) I felt so sad to see young children
            suffering from these kind of illness instead of living )
            few moments later we were in the second floor wich is
            different from the other. It was really large and so
            calme all the rooms were open and I could see some
            patient moat of them were sleeping. Except one room ,
            it was locked .
            <br> 
            I asked jules « what’s the matter with that room »
             <br> 
            She said « ow better of u not to know »
             <br> 
            « what do you mean ?) she nods « its room 45 , it’s
            dedicated to one patient, …. And last week … ) then
            tried to speak softer « last week he tried he tried to
            suicide) I was shocked « what ! Suicide… but why » 
            <br> 
            « no one knows. His last doctor . Just gave his
            dismissing without explanation) .. it was terrible I said «
            is there anyone who tried to search moore and his
            situation»
            <br>
            « no off course no one of the doctors tried to take a
            look on his situation) than I took some second to think
            rationed and I heard jules’s voice « don’t tell me u are
            going to be his doctor » 
            <br>
            (Why not , it’s a job and also he is a human being and
            he has the right to live )
            <br> 
            ( seriously Stella it’s ur first day try to strat by something
            casual and fluent)
            <br> 
            ( don’t worry jules , there’s nothing to fear .. )
            <br>
             I knocked the door of the room twice but the’re was no
            respond i took a deep breath and i stepped in the room
            . A mix of excitement and a touch of nervousness
            setteled in . The room was adorned muted colors . He
            was sitting next to the window reading a book _ he was
            so charming, the soft sunlight stream trought the
            window were casting a warm glow on his face , and I
            felt that I saw him somewhere but I can’t remember ….
            However he is my first patient.
            <br> <br> 
             Steve {justify-content=center } h2
            <br> <br> 
            It’s all déjà vu
            Yes ! It’s her. I m sure it’s Stella , but how ! Does she did
            it ! Her dream job become true ? I m shocked, I can’t
            be sure if it’s her or not ; but it’s surely Stella with her
            long weavy hair, her shinny smile, and her gorgeous
            eyes . But the question is how ?
            <br> <br> 
             Stella {justify-content=center } h2
            <br> <br>
            “Good afternoon , how are doing ?” I said gently, he
            stared at me with those eyes whom reminded me of
            someone but I can’t know who it is . And he
            continued his reading
            “ i’m Dr. Bloom , you’re new doctor ”
            And this time I heard his voice “ my doctor... what a
            shame ”
            <br> 
            Honestly it’s complicated. He might have trust issues
            and building trust in therapy takes time . Sow it’s
            important to make him feel comfortable on talking with
            me . I tried again but in a different way .
            <br> 
            “ you are a reader aren’t you? i’ve always found solace
            in pages of a good book , it’s like entering a different
            world . Don’t u think so ? ”
            <br>
            I thought he wasn’t going to answer but he did , finally
            he did .
            <br>
            “ yeh u got a point of view, it’s one of the few things
            that can distract me from the constant shatter in my
            head “ he said with a smooth voice . 
            <br> 
            “ Books do have a unique way of transporting us . Any
            particular genres or author that u find comforting ?” I
            asked thoughtfully
            <br> 
            “ science fiction , I do like science fiction it takes my
            mind off things ” he said enthusiastically.
            <br> 
            And at that moment knew I have to leave. It’s better
            to leave him alone now . I nod “ I think I m gonna enjoy
            talking to you later .... ” and before I finished he
            interrupted me “ Steve, my name is Steve Russo”
            <br>
            <br>
            I was shocked , i found my self in disbelief there is no
            way it’s him _ Steve Russo used to be my best friend_
            but how did he ended up here? , this place doesn’t suit
            him at all . I can’t find a way to link things right now .
            <br>
            I took a deep breath . he didn't notice who I am .
            however , the fact that I know him very well gonna help
            me to make him feel safe and transparent about his
            intentions and decisions . I think my first step is to
            show him that I m interested about his hobbies and his
            way of thinking
            <br> 
             Steve {justify-content=center } h2
            <br> <br>
            They say time heals but no, time forgets. it’s been 16
            years since I met Stella, but here we are she can’t even
            remember the one who have been always by her side
            regardless of what happened . I wasn’t only here refuge
            but I was also the shoulder she could rely on. we were
            best friend like the stars in the dark sky . She used to
            bring happiness, warmth and brighten up my life just
            like the sun . but we get separated after she
            demanaged with her father after her mother’ s death.
            She was the one who needed my help. but it’s not the
            case anymore , it’s me who need her by my side and
            she will without even noticing .
            <br>
            The whispering are back , oh not now . I .... I want to
            get out of here .... I can see it again . Everything is
            Blurry, no .. It’s dark where am I?. I ....voices ... voices
            in my head .... no please It’s enough... why it happens
            to me every time ? ...I try to live peacefully . Please
            <br> <br>
            Stella {justify-content=center} h2
            He was lying on his bed he Looked so tired , his face
            was pale like if he didn’t eat a plate since a while .
            Once his eyes met mine , he smiled but I felt it was a
            sad smile . He’s suffering from something. He wants to
            escape from something but he can’t. That’s my mission
            <br> 
            “ Stella, you came back ” he said , he tried to get up
            but he seemed very weak , . I sat near to his bed .
            <br>
            “ off course I am , did you think I wouldn’t come ” I
            said with an intention that he has been trough so many
            trouble of betrayed surely from the one close to him .
            <br>
            “ yeh , it’s just ... I wasn’t expecting you back . All the
            previous doctors lost interest after their first session
            with me ............. maybe I am the problem ” 
            <br>
            “ oh Steve! let’s say I am a bit different, in a good way » <br> 
            ” he stared at me with his credentials eyes as if he
            found an intecell of hope and safety on what I have
            said .
            <br> 
            “ and guess what I bring you “ I said with excitement.
            Landing him the box .
            <br> 
            “ oh , new books , it’s exactly what I need in this place ,
            how did know .. omg ! Stella ... I can’t find the exact
            words .. I am “ he talked with an immense happiness
            like a little boy who just found some candy .
            <br>
            “ glad you like it , Steve u told me u like science fiction
            books , most of these are on your taste . “ actually i
            lied he was my best friend of course I know what kind
            of books he prefers without even telling me. I still
            remember how he used to like reading , each time he
            finished a book he became so excited and impatient to
            talk about it ,
            <br>
            “ maybe u didn’t pay attention, but u kind of gave me
            protection “ he said with a voice 
            <br>
            “ what do you mean? from what u need to be
            protected from ?”
            <br> 
            “ .... from me , ”
            <br>
            <br> 
            His answers made blood stop flowing in my veins but I
            tried to hide it
            <br> 
            “ sow books just help you ?”
            <br> 
            “ Yeah , their silence doesn’t demand anything, “
            <br>
            I was in the point to tell him that he can trust me and
            that I can listen to his taught , but it's too soon step by
            step he will tell me .
            <br> <br>
            
             Steve {justify-content=center } h2 
            In English we call it overthinking and in poetry it’s (the
            storms in my hade who ruin the garden that my soul
            holds ) . I never taught it would be like this : i confess
            to the unseen audience . The weight of my emotions
            spills into the room . why is it too hard to make sense
            of everything ?. this room became a canvas for the
            unspoken, a space where the words I dare not to share
            with others find there fleeting existence and so I sit
            alone engaged in a silent dialogue with my mind
            <br> <br> 
             Stella {justify-content=center } h2
            <br> <br> 
            In the calm solitude of the room , steve seated in a
            comfortable chair newt to the window , he appeared
            engrossed in a dialogue with his own taught . As the
            murmured words escape each syllable carries the
            height of an internal narrative . The tone was hushed as
            if he is sharing secrets with an audience he’s the only
            one who can see it .
            <br> 
            “ what a nice weather to start a day “ I said while I was
            opening the window . “ let’s take a break from these
            usual sessions in this boring room , maybe we should
            go to the yard , what to you think ? “
            <br>
            “ no , I don’t like full places “ he said whit an deep
            conviction
            <br>
            “ come on Steve, let’s jus try it , you’ll change your
            mind “ I didn’t wait for his answer and I left the room .
            Moments later he was with me in the yard , the
            sunlight streamed trough to the leaves as we settled on
            a bench . With a warm smile I suggest to play a little
            game “ let’s delve into a different kind of conversation ,
            truth or dare ! “
            <br><br> 
            we used to play this game a lot when we were younger
            , i still remember how we were enjoying life even with
            these little things . It was simple and too clear.
            <br> <br> 
            “Truth: can you share a cherished from your childhood
            that never fail to bring a smile to you r face ? “ I tried to
            start with a simple question to make things easier for
            him <br>
            He hesitated firstly but the he said “ it was a Sunday
            morning and I was taking breakfast – some cereals with
            milk _ with a friend , then she said a joke and we
            started laughing very hard to the point the milk
            from my noise “ 
            <br> 
            I still remember that memory it was who said the joke (
            what did one wall say to the other wall ? I will meet
            you on the corner) it’s stupid now but we were
            children off course it made us laughing
            <br> 
            “ oh ! That’s seems funny , it’s your turn now , ask me
            whatever you want “ he stay silent for a moment then
            he surprised me whit his strange question
            “What does life mean to you ?” I knew at that second
            that my answer could change everything to the best or
            the worst .
            “ it’s about finding purpose, spreading happiness and
            making an impact in the world “
            “ and what if we can’t find the purpose? “ he said with
            a voice
            “ off course we can find a purpose to live “
            " No your are wrong, life is a waste of time , we don’t
            have the right to live ..... I don’t have the right to live...
            the problem is me ..... “ he talked with a terrifying voice
            , like if he is nit the one who was talking before . I knew
            ( this person, is not Steve, I don’t know him )
            Steve
            I think i think i think i think i think i think i think .....
            until I can’t think anymore then I drown drown drown
            drown drown in thoughts I can’t control anymore.
            They were destroying me , I tried not to talk but
            silence was a killer too. I found my self in my room ,
            where I used to daydream about things will never
            happen . I stared blankly at that wall trying to ignore
            the whispers that echoed in my mind like a chorus of
            ghosts. They were always there , I clenched my fists ,
            wiling them to go away but they only grew louder more
            insistent until I felt like I was drowning in a sea of sound
            and fury .
            I can hardly remember what happen before I went here
            or they went me here . I’m feeling like i’m not the same
            person , like if there’s two version of me . Because I
            just feel that there’s a contradiction on my decisions
            and thoughts. It feels like my life is a play ,
            sometimes I am the main character and sometimes
            times I am just a side character .
            Oh ! Stella .... where is she ? I can hardly open my eyes
            , oh no, did she left me ? ..... no she would never do
            that ...... ,
            Stella
            After that unexpected encounter at the clinic I found
            my self grappling with the hanging images that my eyes
            had witnessed. Upon returning home , the world
            around me seemed blurred I had struggled to see the
            road and u couldn’t focus on anything, my min was
            haunted by the question “why?”
            Collapsing into bed hoping to find solace and escape
            the overwhelming thoughts that accumulated in my
            brain
            As I lay there , it became evident that sleep is not the
            answer . It wasn’t the right way to seek refuge in rest .I
            took out my laptop and tried to formulate a diagnostic
            of my patient Steve but each time it’s the same
            conclusion.
            Tears welled up eyes as flood of disbelief engulfed me .
            It seems impossible, it was the last thing I would think
            about however I can’t change this bitter reality
            -Steve suffers from schizophrenia-
            these words echoes in my mind i still cannot believe
            that he And my mother has the same trouble , no , I
            can’t loose him , I can’t....
            Stella
            “ i’m sorry Dr. Bloom but we can’t allow you to treat
            Steve russo anymore “ the directore Alex said , his
            voice heavy with regret “it’s nothing personal you
            understand but the board feels that your connection to
            the patient poses a conflict of interest, and we can’t
            what happened lately “
            I felt a surge of anger rise within me , hit and fierce but
            I could control all of these emotions refusing to let him
            consume me , I would never give up on Steve and I
            would f fight for him no matter what it took .
            “ but , Doctor . I made a progress with him everything
            was going on the plan “ I said trying to convince him
            “ no , you made a mess . I ‘ve never seen Steve on that
            way , “ he said with a higher tone
            “ but it means one clear thing , that I made a progress .
            No one of the several doctors arrived at this stage “
            “ Dr. Bloom , I can’t risk it . He is a danger “ his words
            were hanging heavy in the air . How dare he could
            name him as danger I couldn’t stop my self and I said “
            you have to understand something too . Steve isn’t just
            a patient to me , he is a person , a human being who
            deserve to be treated with dignity and respect . And if
            it means challenging the status quo , then so be it . I
            will not stand by and watch him fall through the cracks
            because of some misguided frat of stigma “
            There’s a moment of tense silence , I looked at him
            then he slowly noted “ I understand, and I respect your
            dedication to your patient but there are protocol s we
            have to follow , for the sake of everyone involved “
            “ please , just give me another chance , please , I can’t
            see him suffering alone again, “ I knew he was doing his
            job but that didn’t make it any easier to accept .
            “ one more chance, if you ruin it’s gonna be over , deal
            ? “ without waiting my answer he left the room leaving
            me with my messy thoughts
            I set in my office trying to make a new plan , but all I
            think about is Steve I couldn’t stop my self in thinking
            about him . Maybe seeing him from distance will help
            me to think better . On my way to his room 45 , I
            passed by the activity hall, I heard a beautiful melody,
            I wonder who is this talented person . As I enter to the
            area who was full of other patient , each one of them
            was busy on doing something -drawing , playing games
            ...- but I was shocked when I saw the one who’s was
            playing the violin, it was him _ Steve _ he occupied a
            corner of the community area , his fingers were
            trembling slightly as they trace of the strings of the
            simple violin. The sound of his playing resonated with
            raw emotion each cord echoing the turmoil within his
            soul . A haunting melody that speaks of pain and hop .
            Once he saw me , he stopped playing . Like if he was
            shocked of seeing me . My brain just stopped thinking
            until I found him standing next to me . And for the first
            time I realised that he taller than me . He noded
            “oh Stella! Long time no see “
            “ yeh ! How have you been ? “ I said , then I heard his
            answer “ actually I missed our discussions “
            I felt that I’m not doing my best , a patient like Steve
            should have access to every single thing he wants .
            “it was busy days , but here I am “ he just kept staring
            at me with his green eyes.
            “ Tell me everything. Tell me nothing, I will listen , even
            when you have nothing to offer by just silence I will
            listen “ I knew exactly this is what he needed the most ,
            he doesn’t want advices, he need someone who listen
            to him . And that person will be me not as his
            psychiatrist but as his best friend.
            “ by the way , how did became this good on playing
            violin?”
            “ Oh ! It’s a long story “ He seemed excited to share
            with me new information about him
            “ it should be ! Your playing was insane , I never new
            you are talented at that point “ I lied , I kenw how
            talented he is but , he is not ready to know the fact
            about me .
            “ it all started in the elementary school , i used to be an
            introvert, I just found solace and peace on musical
            instruments and books as you know . That’s it from that
            time I worked on improving this “ he said with shinny
            eyes .
            “ oh ! I would like to hear you playing again “
            “ Ugh ! It’s gonna be harder since your watching me “
            he said with a little smile
            “ Come on ! I want to hear you soo badly “ I insist
            He looked at my eyes tried to talk however he just took
            his violin, once he started playing , I felt that I was to
            another world , every single move he did , every blink
            of eye , every little move add a gorgeous touch on his
            appearances . The sound was too peaceful, no one
            would have the intention that this person doesn’t have
            any mental troubles.
            He finished, and waited me to talk, I was speechless
            “ you did an amazing job , this talent should not still
            hidden “
            “ you got a point of view..... but I don’t think I deserve
            it , someone like me shouldn’t be known”
            “ Steve, what are you talking about “ I said waiting for
            his answer
            “ it’s just .... I am ... “
            I understood what he meant , I said quickly
            “ you are just better like this “
            Steve
            The thing i am most afraid of is me , of not knowing
            what i am going to do , of not knowing what i am doing
            right now .
            I found myself lost in my thoughts again, pacing back
            and forth in this room as i mulled over the events of
            the past few days . "What's the point of all this?" I
            muttered to myself , my voice was echoing in the
            empty room. Lately, the weight of life's challenges
            seemed unbearable, and i couldn't shake the feeling of
            exhaustion and despair. As i contemplated my
            existence, a troubling notion crept into my mind – the
            idea that death might offer a respite from the pain and
            turmoil of living. It wasn't the first time i had
            entertained such thoughts, but this time they felt more
            persistent, more insistent. i wondered if perhaps death
            held the promise of peace, of release from the
            relentless struggle that seemed to define this life. Yet,
            even as i entertained these dark thoughts, a small voice
            within me whispered of hope, reminding me that there
            are people who cared about me, who would miss me if
            I were gone. And so, torn between the allure of
            oblivion and the faint glimmer of hope, I found him at a
            crossroads, unsure of which path to choose.
            Stella
            I took a deep breath and knocked the door . he was
            talking on the phone . once he saw me , he tried to
            finish the call quickly . I prepared myself to any reaction
            from his part , then I tried to talk with confident “ I
            met steve yesterday , everything was good , therefore
            there’s no need to panic . it’s my job to make him feel
            better end that’s exactly what I’m planning to do ” I
            waited for his answer impatiently “ well done Dr.Bloom
            keep going on this way and you’ll see how competent
            you are ” he said .
            I couldn’t find a way to link things at that moment
            “But …. Last time you wanted to …….”
            “ I understand , it was a part of my plan and it worked
            as you see ”
            “ What do you mean , what plan are you talking
            about?”
            “I’ve never seen steve on that way ,no one of his exdoctors arrived at this point , I found out that he react
            easily with you ,,,, I wanted to make sure that you’ll
            never leave him alone as the others ”
            His words made me in disbelief I felt proud of myself ,I
            proved to the director that I have much competences .
            “ And if you don’t mind we have a new patient , his
            family left him here last week . I think you are the one
            ho should take care of him ”
            What a nice way to start my day , I like helping people
            especially those one who can’t rely on their self then I
            nodded :
            “Yes without further though , I will see him right now”
            “I like it when you talk with this energy Dr.bloom ” he
            said
            “Thank you , I appreciate it “
            I went to my office and find the file of my new patient
            ,named - Nataneil ( still looking for his last name ;))
            , twenty one years old . it’s written that he has dipolar
            disorder _ it’s a condition where a patient has both
            manic and depressive states _ it’s was my first time to
            deal with this kind of situation . i went to his room 21 .
            but he wasn’t there . I talked to jules about him and
            she told me he would probably be in the yard , I didn’t
            even know his face but I just went there . the area was
            full of others…… some nurses . I spent some moments
            looking for a guy in his twentieth . when I couldn’t find
            him . I decided to go back an come later . however
            when I was leaving I saw him , at first I thought that it
            should someone else , I couldn’t think until I found
            myself standing next to him ; he didn’t pay attention to
            me , I took a quick look on his face . and I realized that
            he look after steve a little bit, both of them have green
            eyes , his hair is blond too . what a coincidence I
            whispered to my self
            Nataneil
            I don’t belong to this place ,it’s so strange . people are
            acting so weirdly here . they are insane . ugh ! how can
            I get out of here . it’s obvious that there’s a huge
            different between me and others . if I try to explain
            they will think that I’m insane too , If I didn’t talk they
            will think the same , why should I bother my self then?
            . despite all of this I have to get out of here no matter
            what it costs .
            I was admiring the birds who where fling I envied them
            , they have freedom , I wish I were just like them .
            then I heard a little voice coming next to me
            “I envy them too . it’s unfair to see them living without
            any troubles or keeping them like exclaves ” she
            said .
            Wow. how could she know what I was exactly thinking
            about , she was a young girl , wavy hair ,gorgeous eyes
            , she wore a blouse , maybe she’s a doctor . I tried not
            to answer and I left her there .
            Stella
            He was so rude , at least he had to say something .
            I didn’t want to waste any more time, I had a session
            with steve ,so I went to his room 45 and decided to
            make a look on my new patient after I finished
             Good morning steve , I said with a shiny smile
            “Oh stella hi “ he said with a
            “You seem upset what happened ?”
            “Nothing important “
            “Come on I’m sure there’s something “
            “It’s a dream “
            “Oh , now I’m curious you , know what was it about ?”
            “I was alone , everything was dark ……there was a killer
            silence …… no I heard someone talking to me …. That
            was me ….. no it wasn’t ……oh yes it was me ,with
            every single details like if I were seeing myself in a
            mirror “
            I was shocked and scared at the same time ,
            “Can you remember what he said ? “
            He hesitated at first but after few seconds he said
            “Leave , you don’t deserve this life …..leave …. Now
            leave …now now now . and the voice just kept
            getting louder and louder until I woke up .”
            His situation is getting worst day by day</p>
